# FinalYearComputingProject
Final Year Project - "Use of a Web Application As a Method of Increasing Participation Within a Schooling Environment". This project enables students of a quiet demeanor and who may be afraid to ask questions in large lecture halls, to propose questions over the live-chat system which lecturers can then answer and deal with accordingly. In addition, the chats are saved to the database and can be searched for via the search engine in order to gain more knowledge in a certain topic. Other web pages include courses information, timetables, admin and contact information.
